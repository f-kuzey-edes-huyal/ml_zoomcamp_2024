Use ```--version``` to find out

## Answere 1 

I initially created a folder named hw_deployment. Then, using the Anaconda prompt, I activated the ml-zoomcamp environment by running conda activate ml-zoomcamp. After that, I navigated to my folder by using cd ```hw_deployment```. I installed pipenv in this folder by running ```pip install pipenv```, which helps create a virtual environment. To check the installed version of pipenv, I ran pipenv.__version__, which returned __'2024.2.0'__.
